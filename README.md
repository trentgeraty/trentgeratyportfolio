AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

This weeks challenge was to create a website from scratch while using some of the knowledge we have learned this past week. 

At the top of the page I plaed my image while directly below that I created 3 sections of the page at the top with working links to the rest of the page. 

Deployed Link: https://trentgeraty.github.io/trentgeratyportfolio/
